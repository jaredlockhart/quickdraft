# Quickdraft

Quickdraft was a project I worked on at my first job in 2009-2010. It was a mobile sports drafting
app for iPhone that was built entirely in JS/HTML/CSS.

I find it interesting to look back on because it was essentially what we'd call a Progressive Web App/
Single Page Application today, but those weren't really common ideas back then. When the iPhone first
launched it had very good first class support for this concept. It supported hardware accelerated
animations, cached resources via a manifest file, offline storage, etc.

It's funny to look back on now, a single file with a huge amount of procedural jQuery, but it worked.
